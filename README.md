RC Open Source Project
======================

Remote-control Open Source Project is a open source control panel software originally made to control Blockland dedicated servers. Consists of a website (control panel) and a server-side program (Java .jar for OS X, C++ executable for Linux and Windows).


While it was originally built for Blockland servers, it can easily be forked to work with Torque Game Engine/Torque Game Engine Advanced/Torque3D games that support dedicated servers. 

Also, the project will likely be ported to Unturned after it is complete.

Feel free to fork this project to any other game and submit a pull request for the web panel and/or server program. I would like
to expand this to as many games as possible.
